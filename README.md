# Firebase Data Access Before Snapshot Populated

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase: attempting to access data from a document snapshot before it's fully populated.  This often happens with asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version.  The issue is explained in detail below.

## Problem

The Firebase SDK's asynchronous nature can lead to errors if you try to access data immediately after initiating a query. The data might not have been fetched yet.  This typically results in `undefined` or similar errors.

## Solution

The solution uses promises or async/await to ensure that the data is fully loaded before accessing any of its properties. This approach prevents the premature access errors.
